				<h1>Detective Work</h1>

				Between your bouts of self-narration and drinking whiskey on the rocks, you might get a case or two to solve.<br>
				To have the best chance to solve your case, follow these directions:
				<p>
				<ol>
					<li>Go to the crime scene. </li>
					<li>Take your scanner and scan EVERYTHING (Yes, the doors, the tables, even the dog). </li>
					<li>Once you are reasonably certain you have every scrap of evidence you can use, find all possible entry points and scan them, too. </li>
					<li>Return to your office. </li>
					<li>Using your forensic scanning computer, scan your scanner to upload all of your evidence into the database.</li>
					<li>Browse through the resulting dossiers, looking for the one that either has the most complete set of prints, or the most suspicious items handled. </li>
					<li>If you have 80% or more of the print (The print is displayed), go to step 10, otherwise continue to step 8.</li>
					<li>Look for clues from the suit fibres you found on your perpetrator, and go about looking for more evidence with this new information, scanning as you go. </li>
					<li>Try to get a fingerprint card of your perpetrator, as if used in the computer, the prints will be completed on their dossier.</li>
					<li>Assuming you have enough of a print to see it, grab the biggest complete piece of the print and search the security records for it. </li>
					<li>Since you now have both your dossier and the name of the person, print both out as evidence and get security to nab your baddie.</li>
					<li>Give yourself a pat on the back and a bottle of the ship's finest vodka, you did it!</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
				It really is that easy! Good luck!

				<h1>Nuclear Explosives 101</h1>
				Hello and thank you for choosing the Syndicate for your nuclear information needs. Today's crash course will deal with the operation of a Nuclear Fission Device.<br><br>

				First and foremost, DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING UNTIL THE BOMB IS IN PLACE. Pressing any button on the compacted bomb will cause it to extend and bolt itself into place. If this is done, to unbolt it, one must completely log in, which at this time may not be possible.<br>

				<h2>To make the nuclear device functional</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Place the nuclear device in the designated detonation zone.</li>
					<li>Extend and anchor the nuclear device from its interface.</li>
					<li>Insert the nuclear authorisation disk into the slot.</li>
					<li>Type the numeric authorisation code into the keypad. This should have been provided.<br>
					<b>Note</b>: If you make a mistake, press R to reset the device.
					<li>Press the E button to log on to the device.</li>
				</ul><br>

				You now have activated the device. To deactivate the buttons at anytime, for example when you've already prepped the bomb for detonation, remove the authentication disk OR press R on the keypad.<br><br>
				Now the bomb CAN ONLY be detonated using the timer. Manual detonation is not an option. Toggle off the SAFETY.<br>
				<b>Note</b>: You wouldn't believe how many Syndicate Operatives with doctorates have forgotten this step.<br><br>

				So use the - - and + + to set a detonation time between 5 seconds and 10 minutes. Then press the timer toggle button to start the countdown. Now remove the authentication disk so that the buttons deactivate.<br>
				<b>Note</b>: THE BOMB IS STILL SET AND WILL DETONATE<br><br>

				Now before you remove the disk, if you need to move the bomb, you can toggle off the anchor, move it, and re-anchor.<br><br>

				Remember the order:<br>
				<b>Disk, Code, Safety, Timer, Disk, RUN!</b><br><br>
				Intelligence Analysts believe that normal corporate procedure is for the Rogue Trader to secure the nuclear authentication disk.<br><br>

				Good luck!
